# Home Page

Hi! I am Nico, a researcher taking interest in applied cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies.
My work focuses on zero-knowledge proofs, their security and applications.
I also dabble in related topics such as threshold cryptography and MPC.

Aside from my own research, I enjoy writing educational content, explainers and technical summaries for all levels of understanding.
You can find some of these articles in the *Technical Writing* section below.

Currently, I am a Research Associate at [Geometry](https://geometry.xyz).
I am also a recurring co-host on the [ZeroKnowledge Podcast](https://zeroknowledge.fm).

# About me

I am also a musician, my main instrument is the bass.
Since 2015, I have been writing, recording and touring as part of [HMLTD](https://www.hmltd.org).

When I am not proving things or making music, I like to play chess.
Happy to play some games online or in person when we cross paths.
