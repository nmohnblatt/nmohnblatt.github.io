# Home Page

Hi! I am Nico, a researcher taking interest in applied cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies.
My work focuses on zero-knowledge proofs, their security and applications.
I also dabble in related topics such as threshold cryptography and MPC.

Aside from my own research, I enjoy writing educational content, explainers and technical summaries for all levels of understanding.
You can find some of these articles in the *Technical Writing* section below.

Currently, I am a Research Associate at [Geometry](https://geometry.xyz).
I am also a recurring co-host on the [ZeroKnowledge Podcast](https://zeroknowledge.fm).

## Technical Writing

**[ZK Jargon Decoder](https://nmohnblatt.github.io/zk-jargon-decoder/)**: I write (and try to maintain) informal definitions for jargon commonly found in technical writing.

**Mental Poker in the Age of SNARKs**, [Part 1](https://geometry.xyz/notebook/mental-poker-in-the-age-of-snarks-part-1) and [Part 2](https://geometry.xyz/notebook/mental-poker-in-the-age-of-snarks-part-2).
We revisit the famous *mental poker* problem with the efficient proving techniques that emerged between 2010-2022.

**Paper Speedrun** series.
A series of short and accessible paper summaries for the [Geometry blog](https://geometry.xyz/notebook).

## Development
Most of the cryptographic code I write are proof-of-concept implementations using Rust.

- Arke cryptographic library.
This library contains the cryptographic primitives needed for our implementation of Arke (see papers above).
These include Shamir secret sharing, an identity-based key exchange, a SNARK-based protocol for blind signature verification and a secret handshake.
Built with [arkworks](https://github.com/arkworks-rs). ([code](https://github.com/asonnino/arke/tree/main/code/arke/crypto))

- A field-agnostic library for Mental Poker using threshold encryption and NARKs, *with Andrija Novakovic and Kobi Gurkan*.
Built with [arkworks](https://github.com/arkworks-rs). ([code](https://github.com/geometryresearch/mental-poker), [intro documentation](https://hackmd.io/@nmohnblatt/SJKJfVqzq))

- Proof-toolbox. A collection of common tools used in ZK applications, *with Andrija Novakovic, Kobi Gurkan and Koh Wei Jie*. Built with [arkworks](https://github.com/arkworks-rs). ([code](https://github.com/geometryresearch/proof-toolbox))

# About me

I am also a musician, my main instrument is the bass.
Since 2015, I have been writing, recording and touring as part of [HMLTD](https://www.hmltd.org).

When I am not proving things or making music, I like to play chess.
Happy to play some games online or in person when we cross paths.
