Security reductions are the basic building block of security proofs.
The idea is to show that breaking a protocol $\Pi$ is at least as hard as breaking some underlying assumption or protocol $\Pi&rsquo;$.

  <p>This brief post collects resources and tutorials that I found helpful when learning and teaching <em>how to write security proofs</em>. The main tools are <em>security reductions</em> and <em>game-hopping</em>.
I list resources for each of them and then expand on what I found useful in each.</p>

<p><em>Security reductions</em> are the basic building block of security proofs.
The idea is to show that breaking a protocol $\Pi$ is at least as hard as breaking some underlying assumption or protocol $\Pi&rsquo;$.
I like the introduction given in <em>Introduction to Modern Cryptography</em> by Katz and Lindell in Chapter 3.1.3, p. 58.</p>
<p>There are plenty of examples of such proofs in <em>A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography</em> by Boneh and Shoup.
The first one being in Section 2.2.3.1 &ldquo;Message recovery attacks&rdquo;.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Complex protocols rely on more than one assumption or underlying primitives.
In such cases, a single reduction will not be enough to give a full security analysis.
Instead we want to use a strategy known as &ldquo;game-hopping&rdquo; or &ldquo;sequence of games&rdquo;.
This technique is used in most papers but is rarely taught explicitly.</p>
<p><strong>Shoup&rsquo;s game-hopping.</strong>
The first rigorous <em>and</em> manageable explanation of the technique that I found was Victor Shoup&rsquo;s tutorial on &ldquo;Sequences of games: a tool for taming complexity in security proofs&rdquo;.
The framework is formal enough that we won&rsquo;t be writing broken proofs but at the same time is not too restrictive and preserves intuition.
I also like that it gives names to three types of common game hops:</p>
<ul>
<li>transitions based on indistinguishability.</li>
<li>transitions based on failure events.</li>
<li>bridging steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Section 1.2 also sheds some light on the term &ldquo;hybrid argument&rdquo; which seems to pop up in many papers but can be quite mystical if not explained properly.
In particular, he explains that they are a special case of the &ldquo;sequence of games&rdquo; strategy where all hops are transitions based on indistinguishability.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Hybrid&rdquo; arguments.</strong> Since I mention hybrid arguments, I didn&rsquo;t get my &ldquo;A-HA&rdquo; moment from Shoup&rsquo;s manuscript.
For me it came in two steps.
The first was understanding what indistinguishability games are from Boneh and Shoup; the second was the example applications of a hybrid argument given in Section 3 of &ldquo;An Overview of the Hybrid Argument&rdquo; by Fischlin and Mittelbach.</p>
<h2 id="proofs-irl">Proofs IRL</h2>
<p>In practice, the above techniques are used in different styles.
For example, in the SNARG book (Chiesa and Yogev, <a href="http://snargsbook.org"><em>Building Cryptographic Proofs from Hash Functions</em></a>), the authors prefer to define &ldquo;probabilistic experiments&rdquo; and write proofs by analyzing the corresponding probabilities.
These could have also been cast as games; it&rsquo;s a matter of taste and convenience.</p>
<p>You will also find that authors often skip steps e.g., &ldquo;this can be shown using a simple [reduction / hybrid argument]&rdquo; or &ldquo;if event A happens, we have found a collision in the hash function&rdquo;.
The latter sentence is in fact a transition based on a failure event and a reduction from the failure event to the collision-finding game.
However, since both of these are so standard, we tend to save space and spare the reader from unnecessary reading and formalism.</p>
