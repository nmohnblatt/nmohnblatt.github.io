      <title>Proximity Gaps: What Happened and How Does It Affect our SNARKs</title>

      <description>A series of recent papers just disproved the proximity gaps conjecture, which has everyone wondering if hash-based SNARKs are in trouble. We break down what actually happened using some helpful visuals—think of it as understanding which parameter choices are safe versus which ones are now confirmed to be risky. The post walks you through the different security zones (proven safe, conjectured safe, and definitely not safe), explains how these new results connect to other open math problems, and shows what it means for real-world SNARKs in terms of proof sizes and performance trade-offs.</description>
