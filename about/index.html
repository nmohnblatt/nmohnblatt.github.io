<meta name="description" content="About
I am a researcher focusing on privacy-enhancing technologies and all the cryptographic tools that enable them.
My work is mainly centred around proof systems (zero-knowledge or not) and their security.
I also touch on related topics such as threshold cryptography and MPC.
I enjoy writing and producing educational content. Mostly in the form of explainers, technical summaries and whiteboard sessions for all levels of understanding.
You can find some of these in the Blog section, in the ZK Jargon Decoder or on ZK Hack." />

  <h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>I am a researcher focusing on privacy-enhancing technologies and all the cryptographic tools that enable them.
My work is mainly centred around proof systems (zero-knowledge or not) and their security.
I also touch on related topics such as threshold cryptography and MPC.</p>
<p>I enjoy writing and producing educational content. Mostly in the form of explainers, technical summaries and whiteboard sessions for all levels of understanding.
You can find some of these in the <a href="https://nmohnblatt.me/blog/">Blog</a> section, in the <a href="https://zkjargon.github.io">ZK Jargon Decoder</a> or on <a href="https://zkhack.dev">ZK Hack</a>.</p>
<p>Read more about my current projects in the <a href="https://nmohnblatt.me/now/">Now</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="previously">Previously</h2>
<p>I joined the crypto/ZK industry in 2022 as a researcher and first hire at <a href="https://geometry.xyz">Geometry</a>. I was very fortunate to work with a team of brilliant investors, researchers and engineers, with whom I continued to collaborate as a founding member of its spin-out <a href="https://geometry.dev">Geometry Research</a> and later a research consultant with <a href="https://baincapitalcrypto.com">Bain Capital Crypto</a>.</p>
<p>Before all that, I had a short stint (1.5 year) in the cybersecurity industry.
I worked as a SOC analyst and pentester at a small UK-based firm.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>I studied electrical &amp; electronic engineering at Imperial College London (BEng) and information security at UCL (MSc).</p>
<h2 id="outside-cryptography">Outside cryptography</h2>
<p>If not thinking about cryptography, I am most likely found playing music or chess.
Always up for a quick game if we meet in person!
(The text above quietly omits my whole musician/songwriter arc, but that&rsquo;s a story for another time).</p>
